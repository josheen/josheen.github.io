            "To add on to the Gimbal that I made for our photography club, I created an assistive App that would communicate to our Embedded systems via BLE. By adding features such as object detection we were allowed to explore things such as visual servoing to have a camera physically track an object of interest.",

            "This is a research project sponsored by the Material Engineering Department of the University of Alberta. The goal of this project was to determine the efficacy of ML techniques in the mining process of froth flotation. Here we explored various architectures such as CNNs, auto-encoders, and semi-supervised GANs. ",
